This project is focused on conducting an in-depth analysis of the Covid 19 cases around the world. Using Microsoft SQL, we will study the number of cases, number of vaccinations, number of deaths and other related data. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the impact of pandemic on different countries and regions, as well as to identify any correlations between the data.
