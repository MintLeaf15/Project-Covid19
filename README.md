This project is focused on conducting an in-depth analysis of the Covid 19 cases around the world. Using Microsoft SQL, we will study the number of cases, number of vaccinations, number of deaths and other related data. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the impact of pandemic on different countries and regions, as well as to identify any correlations between the data. 

In conclusion, the analysis from this project showed that United States has the highest number of Covid 19 cases, with more than 100 million cases as of January 2023, followed by India and France. Besides, analysis showed that Cyprus has a high percentage of its population infected with Covid 19. Specifically, at least 70.4% of the population has been infected by the virus. This percentage is much higher than the global average of 17.3%. In Malaysia, the percentage of its population infected with Covid 19 is around 14.8% showing a good indication that Malaysia has effectively enacted measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect its citizens.
